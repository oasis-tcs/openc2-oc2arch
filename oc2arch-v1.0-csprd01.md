### Abstract:
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.

This document describes the Abstract Architecture of OpenC2, to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.

# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a _Command_ is encoded by a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a _Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices. These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device. The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

* The **OpenC2 Architecture Specification** (this document) describes the fundamental structures of OpenC2 and provides a a blueprint for developing Actuator Profiles and Transfer Specifications.

* The **OpenC2 Language Specification** provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for Commands and Responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the Command or Response.

* **OpenC2 Actuator Profiles** specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific Actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely to) implement multiple Actuator profiles. Actuator profiles extend the language by defining Specifiers that identify the Actuator to the required level of precision. Actuator Profiles may define Command Arguments and Targets that are relevant and/or unique to those Actuator functions.

* **OpenC2 Transfer Specifications** utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transport of OpenC2 Messages.

The most common encoding of OpenC2 is in JSON and the most common binding is to HTTP; this document assumes this encoding and binding for all examples. Other encodings and bindings are permitted and are defined in their respective documents.

## 1.5 Goal
Open C2 is an effort to rigorously standardize command and control of vital cyber defense systems.
The Open C2 Architecture Specification (this document) serves as an overarching structural schematic.
Contained herein is a roadmap to the language specifications and various actuator/transfer protocols
that have been established to integrate use case interoperation between functional elements of cyber defense.     

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD]](#iacd):

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions. OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guide the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and implementation agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  A Command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  Commands and Responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of Actions and Targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

# 2 Overview of OpenC2 Architecture

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications for Producers and Consumers to command and execute cyber defense functions. These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications. The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the language content and meaning at the Producer and Consumer of the Command and Response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.

In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 Messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:

1. **Producers**: A Producer is an entity that creates Commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the Command. A Producer may receive and process Responses in conjunction with a Command.
2. **Consumers**: A Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon a Command. A Consumer may create Responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the Producer.

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the Producer, to one or more systems, the Consumer(s), to act on the content of the Command.
2. **Response**: Any information sent back to the Producer as a result of the Command.

The Action and Target components are required. A particular Target may be further refined by the Target type. Procedures to extend the Targets are described in [Section 3.1.4](#314-extensions).

Command Arguments, if present, influence the Command by providing information such as timing, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. Command Arguments are defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification.

An Actuator is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the Command. An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of Actions, Targets and other aspects of this language specification that are required or optional in the context of a particular Actuator. An Actuator Profile may extend the language by defining additional Targets, Arguments, and Actuator Specifiers that are meaningful and possibly unique to the Actuator.

The Actuator may be omitted from a Command and typically will not be included in implementations where the identities of the endpoints are unambiguous or when a high-level effects-based Command is desired and the tactical decisions on how the effect is achieved is left to the recipient.

## 2.1 Terminology used in OpenC2

EDITOR's NOTE - should this section be in section 1.2?

* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g., 'deny').
* **Actuator**: The function performed by the Consumer that executes the Command (e.g., 'Stateless Packet Filtering').
* **Actuator Profile**: EDITOR's NOTE add definition
* **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides additional information on how to perform the Command, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
* **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands. Note that a single device / application can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.
* **Custom Actuator Profile (CAP)**: EDITOR's NOTE add definition
* **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received Command.
* **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target or Actuator to some level of precision.
* **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is performed on the Target (e.g., IP Address).text.

_The content in this section is non-normative._

## 2.2 Commands and Responses

The OpenC2 language has two distinct content types: Command and Response. The Command is sent from a Producer to a Consumer and describes an Action to be performed by an Actuator on a Target. The Response is sent from a Consumer, usually back to the Producer, and is a means to provide information (such as acknowledgment, status, etc.) as a result of a Command.

### 2.2.1 OpenC2 Command
The Command describes an Action to be performed on a Target and may include information identifying the Actuator or Actuators that are to execute the Command.

A Command has four main components, two required and two optional. The required components are the Action and the Target. The optional components are Command Arguments and the Actuator. A Command can also contain an optional Command identifier, if necessary. [Section 3.3.1](#331-openc2-command) defines the syntax of an OpenC2 Command.

The following list summarizes the main four components of a Command.

* **Action** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **Target** (required): The object of the action. The Action is performed on the Target. Properties of the Target, called Target Specifiers, further identify the Target to some level of precision, such as a specific Target, a list of Targets, or a class of Targets.
* **Arguments** (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
* **Actuator** (optional): The Actuator executes the Command. The Actuator will be defined within the context of an Actuator Profile. Properties of the Actuator, called Actuator Specifiers, further identify the Actuator to some level of precision, such as a specific Actuator, a list of Actuators, or a group of Actuators.

The Action and Target components are required and are populated by one of the Actions in [Section 3.3.1.1](#3311-action) and the Targets in [Section 3.3.1.2](#3312-target). A particular Target may be further refined by the Target type definitions in [Section 3.4.1](#341-target-types). Procedures to extend the Targets are described in [Section 3.1.4](#314-extensions).

Command Arguments, if present, influence the Command by providing information such as timing, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to convey the need for acknowledgment or additional status information about the execution of a Command. The valid Arguments defined in this specification are in [Section 3.3.1.4](#3314-command-arguments). Procedures to extend Arguments are described in [Section 3.1.4](#314-extensions).

An Actuator is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the Command. An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of Actions, Targets and other aspects of this language specification that are required or optional in the context of a particular Actuator. An Actuator Profile may extend the language by defining additional Targets, Arguments, and Actuator Specifiers that are meaningful and possibly unique to the Actuator.

The Actuator may be omitted from a Command and typically will not be included in implementations where the identities of the endpoints are unambiguous or when a high-level effects-based Command is desired and the tactical decisions on how the effect is achieved is left to the recipient.

### 2.2.2 OpenC2 Response
The Response is a Message sent from the recipient of a Command. Response messages provide acknowledgment, status, results from a query, or other information. At a minimum, a Response will contain a status code to indicate the result of performing the Command. Additional status text and response fields optionally provide more detailed information that is specific to or requested by the Command. [Section 3.3.2](#332-openc2-response) defines the syntax of an OpenC2 Response.

## 2.3 Producers, Consumers, and Devices

Figure 2-X illustrates three representative
configurations for an OpenC2 Consumer device:

1. The Consumer implements a single Actuator Profile (AP).
1. The Consumer implements multiple APs, which may be all
   different, all the same, or a mixture.
1. The Consumer is a manager for a collection of devices,
   providing an indirect means for the Producer to use
   OpenC2 Commands to influence the operations of those
   devices. The managed devices in the collection may or may
   not be identical.

In configurations 1 and 2, the Producer has direct, explicit
knowledge of the APs implemented by the Consumer.  OpenC2
Commands issued by the Producer directly affect the
operation of the Consumer device.  An example of multiple
instances of the same AP in configuration 2 would be packet
filtering functions on multiple, distinct network
interfaces.

In configuration 3, the Producer has knowledge of the
capabilities supported by the Consumer manager, but only
indirect affect the operation of the managed devices. In
configuration 3 there is no assumption that the interface
between the Consumer manager and the managed devices uses
OpenC2 Commands and Responses.

**Figure 2-X. Producer / Consumer / Device COnfigurations**

## 2.4 Implementations

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1-2 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude any particular approach to implementing the needed functionality (for example, the use of an application-layer message signature function to provide message source authentication and integrity).

![OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model](images/OC2LayeringModel.png)

**Figure 2-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 2-1.

**Table 2-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>([[OpenC2-SLPF-v1.0]](#openc2-slpf-v10), ...) |
| Common Content | Language Specification<br>(this document) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>([[OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0]](#openc2-https-v10), OpenC2-over-CoAP, ...) |
| Secure Transport | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transport** layer provides a communication path between the Producer and the Consumer. OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transport protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transfer- and content-independent mechanism for conveying Messages. A transfer specification maps transfer-specific protocol elements to a transfer-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of Commands and Responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function. An Actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function. Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.

The components of a Command are an Action (what is to be done), a Target (what is being acted upon), an optional Actuator (what is performing the command), and Command Arguments, which influence how the Command is to be performed. An Action coupled with a Target is sufficient to describe a complete Command. Though optional, the inclusion of an Actuator and/or Command Arguments provides additional precision to a Command.

The components of a Response are a numerical status code, an optional status text string, and optional results. The format of the results, if included, depend on the type of Response being transferred.


# 3 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations
(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

# 4 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).
