#### Abstract:
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.

This document describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.

# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is
marked normative._

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and
control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically
uses a request-response paradigm where a _Command_ is encoded by
a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a
_Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a
secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with
status and any requested information.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover
the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices. These
capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its
behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed
device. The capability definitions can be easily extended in a
noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard
capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

OpenC2 is defined across a family of specifications of several types:

* The **OpenC2 Architecture Specification** (this document)
  describes the fundamental structures of OpenC2 and provides a
  blueprint for developing Actuator Profiles and Transfer
  Specifications.

* The **OpenC2 Language Specification** provides the semantics
 for the essential elements of the language, the structure for
  Commands and Responses, and the schema that defines the proper
  syntax for the language elements that represents the Command or
  Response. The Language Specification also defines the
  mechanisms for extending the OpenC2 language.
  [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10)

* **OpenC2 Actuator Profiles** specify the subset of the OpenC2
  language relevant in the context of specific actuator
  functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or
  instances may (in fact are likely to) implement multiple
  profiles. A profile refines the meaning of language
  elements (actions, targets, command arguments, results) used to
  perform the actuator function, and often defines additional
  elmentsthat are relevant and/or unique to that function.

* **OpenC2 Transfer Specifications** utilize existing protocols
  and standards to implement OpenC2 message transfer in specific
  environments. These standards are used for communications and
  security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as
  message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end
  transport of OpenC2 Messages.

The OpenC2 language is described in the Language Specification
using an abstract information model that does not specify any
particular message encoding form (i.e., serialization). The most
common encoding of OpenC2 messages is in JSON and the OpenC2
family of specifications presents examples in JSON format. Other
encodings are permitted and are defined in their respective
documents (e.g., a transfer specification). Similarly, OpenC2
messages can be conveyed using a variety of transfer mechanisms,
using both point-to-point (e.g., HTTPS) and publish/subscribe
(e.g., MQTT) communication models. The selection of message
content encoding is determined by a combination of the
environment where OpenC2 is being applied and the capabilities
and limitations of the chosen transfer specification.

## 1.1 Changes from earlier versions

* Updated conformance section from preliminary draft and refined language
* Added example message exchange in JSON format
* Populated revision history and acknowledgements

## 1.2 Goal

OpenC2 is developing a language for interoperating between
functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language, used
in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer
Specifications, allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to
attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a
collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA
(ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD]](#iacd):

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand
  what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to
  system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in
cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber
defense functions. OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the
IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of
OpenC2 is that the sensing/analytics have been provisioned and
the decision to act has been made. This goal and these
assumptions guide the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of
  abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform- and
  implementation-agnostic manner

* **Concise:**  A Command is intended to convey only the
  essential information required to describe the action required
  and can be represented in a very compact form for
  communications-constrained environments

* **Abstract:**  Commands and Responses are defined abstractly
  and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as
  dictated by the needs of different implementation environments

* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of Actions and
  Targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve
  with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to
  accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

The OpenC2 language assumes that the event has been detected, a
decision to act has been made, the act is warranted, and the
initiator and recipient of the Commands are authenticated and
authorized. The OpenC2 language was designed to be agnostic of
the other aspects of cyber defense implementations that realize
these assumptions.

# 2 OpenC2 Architecture

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications for Producers and Consumers
to command and execute cyber defense functions. These
specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification,
Actuator Profiles (APs), and Transfer Specifications. The OpenC2
[Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) and Actuator Profile
specifications focus on the language content and meaning at the
Producer and Consumer level of Command and Response while the
transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their
exchange. The language is defined abstractly in the Language
Specification, permitting flexibility of message serialization
and transfer protocol choices when implementing OpenC2.
Interoperability between specific OpenC2 implementations is
dependent on the selection of common serialization and transfer
mechanisms.

In general, there are two types of participants involved in the
exchange of OpenC2 Messages, as depicted in Figure 2-1:

1. **Producers**: A Producer is an entity that creates and
   transmits Commands instructing one or more systems to execute
   Actions as specified in the Command. A Producer may receive
   and process Responses in conjunction with a Command.
2. **Consumers**: A Consumer is an entity that receives and may
   act upon a Command. A Consumer may create Responses that
   provide any information captured or necessary to send back to
   the Producer.

**Figure 2-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

![OpenC2 Message Exchange](images/MessageFlow.png)


The Language Specification defines two distinct content types
(i.e., payload structures): Command and Response. The following
example, drawn from the AP for Stateless Packet Filtering
[[SLPF](#openc2-slpf-v10)], illustrates the general structure of
OpenC2 Command and Response message payloads, using the common
JSON serialization. The example action permits `ftp` data
transfers to `3ffe:1900:4545:3::f8ff:fe21:67cf` from any source.

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "allow",
  "target": {
    "ipv6_connection": {
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "dst_addr": "3ffe:1900:4545:3::f8ff:fe21:67cf",
      "src_port": 21
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {}
  }
}
```

In this case the Actuator returns a rule number associated with the allowed interaction.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "results": {
    "slpf": {
      "rule_number": 1234
    }
  }
}
```


## 2.1 Commands

**Command**: An instruction from one system, known as the
Producer, to one or more systems, the Consumer(s), to act on the
content of the Command.

The Command describes an Action to be performed on a Target and
may include information identifying the Actuator or Actuators
that are to execute the Command. A Command can also contain an
optional Command identifier, if necessary. The following list
summarizes the main four components of a Command.

* **Action** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **Target** (required): The object of the action. The Action is
  performed on the Target. Properties of the Target, called
  *Target Specifiers*, further identify the Target to some level of
  precision, such as one specific Target, a list of Targets, or a
  class of Targets.
* **Arguments** (optional): Provide additional information on how
  the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity,
  duration, etc.
* **Profile** (optional): Specifies the Actuator Profile that
  defines the function to be performed by the command.

The Action and Target components are required. A particular
Target may be further refined by the Target type. The [Language
Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) defines procedures to extend the
set of OpenC2 Targets.

Command Arguments, if present, influence the Command by providing
information such as timing, periodicity, duration, or other
details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to
convey the need for acknowledgment or additional status
information about the execution of a Command.

The Profile field, if present, specifies the profile that defines
the function to be performed. A Consumer executes the command if
it supports the specified profile, otherwise the command is
ignored. The Profile field may be omitted and typically will not
be included in implementations where the functions of the
recipients are unambiguous or when a high-level effects-based
command is desired and tactical decisions on how the effect is
achieved is left to the recipient. If Profile is omitted and the
recipient supports multiple profiles, the command will be
executed in the context of each profile that supports the
command's combination of action and target.

## 2.2 Responses

 **Response**: Any information sent back to the Producer as a
 result of the Command.

The Response is sent from a Consumer, usually back to the
Producer, and is a means to provide information (such as
acknowledgment, status, etc.) regarding the results of executing
a Command.  At a minimum, a Response will contain a status code
to indicate the result of performing the Command. Additional
status text and response fields optionally provide more detailed
information that is specific to or requested by the Command.


## 2.3 Design Patterns

This section describes a number of OpenC2 concepts related to
creating working systems using OpenC2 specifications.

### 2.3.1 Producers, Consumers, and Devices

This section discusses four representative configurations for an
OpenC2 Consumer device:

1. The Consumer implements a single function, and therefore
   supports a Actuator Profile (AP).

1. The Consumer implements multiple functions, and therefore
   supports multiple APs, which may be all different, all the
   same, or a mixture.

1. The Consumer is a manager for a collection of devices,
   providing an indirect means for the Producer to use OpenC2
   Commands to influence the operations of those devices. The
   managed devices in the collection may or may not be identical,
   and the interface to them is not assumed to use OpenC2.

1. The Consumer is a manager for a collection of devices that are
   managed using OpenC2, making the device a combined Consumer /
   Producer.

In all of these configurations, "device" is a collective term for
the processing element that is the OpenC2 Consumer. A device
could be a physical or virtual entity in any number of computing
environments. The essential characteristics are that it is a
network-accessible, addressable entity that operates as an OpenC2
Consumer. 

In configurations 1 and 2, the Producer has direct, explicit
knowledge of the APs implemented by the Consumer.  OpenC2
Commands issued by the Producer directly affect the operation of
the Consumer device.

In configurations 3 and 4, the Producer has knowledge of the
capabilities supported by the Consumer manager, but only
indirectly affect the operation of the managed devices. In
configuration 3 there is no assumption that the interface between
the Consumer manager and the managed devices uses OpenC2 Commands
and Responses, whereas in configuration 4 that interface is
explictly OpenC2-based. Implementations with a mixture of OpenC2-
and non-OpenC2-based interactions with the managed devices are
also possible.

#### 2.3.1.1 Single Function Device

Figure 2-2 illustrates the situation with a Producer commanding
an OpenC2 Consumer that implements a single cybersecurity
function, and its corresponding AP. 

**Figure 2-2. Single Function Device**
![Single Function Device](images/Single-Function-Device.drawio.png)

#### 2.3.1.2 Multiple Function Device

Figure 2-3 illustrates the situation with a Producer commanding
an OpenC2 Consumer that implements multiple cybersecurity
function, and their corresponding APs. The cybersecurity
functions may be all different, all the same, or a mixture. An
example of different functions could be an end-user computer
system with anti-virus (AV), endpoint response (ER) and packet
filtering (PF) capabilities. An example of multiple instances of
the same AP in configuration 2 would be packet filtering
functions on multiple, distinct network interfaces.

**Figure 2-3. Multiple Function Device**
![Multiple Function Device](images/Multiple-Function-Device.drawio.png)

#### 2.3.1.3 Actuator Manager Device

Figure 2-4 illustrates the situation where the Consumer fronts a
set of managed devices implementing cybersecurity functions. The
managed devices may implement any mixture of cybersecurity
functions, and the Actuator Manager's interface to those devices
is not using OpenC2.

**Figure 2-4. Actuator Manager Device**
![Actuator Manager Device](images/Actuator-Manager-Device.drawio.png)

#### 2.3.1.4 Intermediate Consumer / Producer Device

Figure 2-5 illustrates the situation where the Consumer fronts a
set of managed devices implementing cybersecurity functions. The
managed devices may implement any mixture of cybersecurity
functions, but in this case the Manager's interface to those
devices explicitly does use OpenC2, making the device an
intermediate, combined Consumer / Producer.

**Figure 2-5. Actuator Manager Device Using OpenC2**
![Actuator Manager Device using OpenC2](images/Actuator-Manager-Device-OpenC2.drawio.png)

### 2.3.2 Action-Target Model

The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a *standard* set of
actions and a *baseline* collection of targets for those actions.
An action-target pair defines a command, as described in [Section
2.1](#21-commands).

The available set of actions for creating OpenC2 commands is
limited to those defined in the Language Specification in order
to encourage commonality and interoperability of implementations.
The function of each action is defined in the Language
Specification, and the set of actions can only be expanded by
modifying the Language Specification. Specifically, the set of
OpenC2 actions cannot be expanded by defining new actions in an
Actuator Profile.

In contrast the baseline set of targets in the Language
Specification is a usable set, but is also explicitly extensible.
This recognizes the diversity of cybersecurity functions and the
corresponding need for function-specific targets beyond the
general purpose set provided in the Language Specification.

There are other automation capabilities (e.g, Microsoft
Powershell) that implement a verb-noun model similar to that used
by OpenC2. Future expansions to the OpenC2 action set should take
advantage of prior work from similar capabilities in selecting
names for actions. This will encourage commonality of usage and
understanding of verbs in automation systems.

### 2.3.3 Introspection Model

A common situation in OpenC2 interactions is the need for a
Producer to determine the capabilities of a Consumer in order to
scope the range of commands that can usefully be sent to that
Consumer. The approach is demonstrated in the Language
Specification's provision of the `"query" : "features"` and
`"query" : "properties"` commands. This "introspection" capability,
defined for OpenC2 as the ability of a Consumer to inform a
Producer of the Consumer's capabilities, enables a degree of
flexible self-configuration of the interactions between Producers
and Consumers. 

Any situation where a Consumer may potentially provide a range of
responses to a Producer's command is a candidate to apply the
introspection technique. For example, where a Consumer may return
a response in any of several data formats or serializations, it
is appropriate to consider a two-stage interaction:

 - **Stage 1:** the Producer identifies the information of interest
   and queries regarding the Consumer's capabilities to provide
   that information. The Consumer responds with a list, possibly
   prioritized, of the ways it can supply the required
   information.

 - **Stage 2:** the Producer selects from among the options provided
   by the Consumer and sends a Command specifying the desired
   packaging of the information. The Consumer responds with the
   required information packaged as specified.

The information provided by the Consumer in stage 1 enables the
Producer to proceed with confidence about the outcome of the
interaction in stage 2.

## 2.4 Implementations

OpenC2 implementations integrate the OpenC2 specifications
described above with related industry specifications, protocols,
and standards. Figure 2-3 depicts the relationships among the
family of OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other
industry standards and environment-specific implementations of
OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the
diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude any particular
approach to implementing the needed functionality (for example,
the use of an application-layer message signature function to
provide message source authentication and integrity).


**Figure 2-3. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**
![OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model](images/OC2-Docs-and-Layers.drawio.png)

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as described
in Table 2-1.

**Table 2-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>([OpenC2-SLPF-v1.0](#openc2-slpf-v10), ...) |
| Common Content | Language Specification |

* The **Secure Transport** layer provides a communication path
  between the Producer and the Consumer. OpenC2 can be layered
  over any standard transport protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transfer- and
  content-independent mechanism for conveying Messages. A
  transfer specification maps transfer-specific protocol elements
  to a transfer-independent set of message elements consisting of
  content and associated metadata.
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of Commands
  and Responses and a set of common language elements used to
  construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language
  elements used to support a particular cyber defense function.
  An Actuator profile defines the implementation conformance
  requirements for that function. Producers and Consumers will
  support one or more profiles.

OpenC2 is intended to be integrated into different systems which
will provide a variety of security services. [Appendix
B](#appendix-b-safety-security-and-privacy-considerations)
describes the possible threats that could affect OpenC2
operations and the security services needed to protect those
operations against such threats. Because the implementation of
these services are beyond the scope of this specification, the
review in Appendix B is for reference purposes and to emphasize
the importance of considering security services in the creation
of OpenC2 implementations.

# 3 Conformance

This section defines the conformance requirements for OpenC2 implementations.

## 3.1 Conformance-Related Definitions

An OpenC2 *Producer* is defined per Section 2 of this document.

An OpenC2 *Consumer* is defined per Section 2 of this document.

The OpenC2 *Transfer Specification List* is defined as:
- oc2-https
- oc2-mqtt

The OpenC2 *Actuator Profile Specification List* is defined as:
- slpf

The *Actuator Profile List* is defined as the list of Actuator
Profiles supported by the Consumer as supplied in the response to
the command:

```
{action:query, target:features, target-specifier:[profiles]}
```

as per Section 4.1 of the Language Specification.

A Consumer's *Actuator Profile List* is composed of two types of
profiles: 
 - Standard Actuator Profiles (SAP), i.e., those on the OpenC2
Actuator Profile Specification List; and 
 - Custom Actuator Profiles (CAP), i.e., those not on the OpenC2
Actuator Profile Specification List.

## 3.2 OpenC2 Producer Conformance Clauses

CC 3.2.1 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Producer MUST only issue OpenC2 commands conforming to OpenC2
Language Specification Section 5.1 Conformance Clause 1.

CC 3.2.2 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Producer MUST only accept responses conforming to OpenC2 Language
Specification Section 5.2 Conformance Clause 2.

CC 3.2.3 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Producer MUST be conformant to OpenC2 Language Specification
Section 5.3 Conformance Clause 3.

CC 3.2.4 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Producer MUST be conformant with at least one transfer
specification in the OpenC2 Transfer Specification List.

## 3.3 OpenC2 Consumer Conformance Clauses

CC 3.3.1 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Consumer MUST only accept OpenC2 commands conforming to OpenC2
Language Specification Section 5.1 Conformance Clause 1.

CC 3.3.2 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Consumer MUST only return responses conforming to OpenC2 Language
Specification Section 5.2 Conformance Clause 2.

CC 3.3.3 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Consumer MUST be conformant to OpenC2 Language Specification
Section 5.4 Conformance Clause 4.

CC 3.3.4 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Consumer MUST be conformant with at least one transfer
specification in the OpenC2 Transfer Specification List.

CC 3.3.5 In order to conform to this specification, an OpenC2
Consumer MUST have an OpenC2 Consumer Actuator Profile List with
at least one entry.

CC 3.3.6 In order to conform to this specification, all SAP
entries on a Consumer's OpenC2 Consumer Actuator Profile List
MUST conform to the corresponding OASIS OpenC2 Actuator Profiles.

## 3.4 OpenC2 CAP Conformance Clauses

CC 3.4.1 In order to conform to this specification, a CAP MUST
extend the functionality covered by a profile on the OpenC2
Actuator Profile Specification List, and MUST conform with the
OpenC2 Actuator Profile Specification being extended. 

For example, if a CAP extends the slpf functionality, the
Consumer must conform to the OASIS OpenC2 SLPF Actuator Profile
Specification. Note if the actuator function is not an extension
to an existing function specified in a published AP, the Consumer
implementation fails this conformance clause. For example, a CAP
fails this clause if it is for malware detection, and there is
not a malware detection SAP.

CC 3.4.2 In order to conform to this specification, all CAP
entries MUST extend the functionality of a SAP in a manner
consistent with the OpenC2 Language Specification section 3.1.4
requirements for extensions.

# Appendix B. Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations

This appendix discusses security concerns related to OpenC2.

## B.1 Overview

Cyber defense systems are high-value targets for an attacker
since disabling detection and response capabilities opens the
door to allow further attacks. There would be great value to an
attacker to turn off the sensors, breach the defenses, disable
responsive actions, and potentially use the cyber defense tools
to attack the network.

## B.2 Threats

There are two threat target areas to address when considering the
security of OpenC2:  

1. Threats to and attacks on the user networks/systems being
defended, and 
1. Attacks directed at OpenC2 itself.  

### B.2.1 Threats to the Networks and Systems Being Defended

By providing the C2 for time-critical response actions OpenC2 is
an enabler of improved cyber defense capabilities for user
networks and systems. However, to the extent that OpenC2 traffic
and processing share resources with those user networks and
systems, those same threats (and mitigations) will also be
applicable to OpenC2. Even if the OpenC2 traffic is segregated
using logical or cryptographic separation, the underlying
physical resources may still be subject to common attacks (and
other threats) that will affect OpenC2 operations.

### B.2.2 Threats to OpenC2 Traffic and Processing

The threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, and impacts to a given
OpenC2 implementation should be analyzed with a focus on the
goals of the attacker and the resulting impacts since these will
be different from a standard user analysis.  Four categories of
threat sources should be addressed:

 * *Malicious Adversaries* (external or insider) â the primary
   source of concern for the security of OpenC2 operations

 * *Non-malicious Users* â mistakes by users, especially
   privileged users, can cause major lapses in cyber defense
   
 * *Structural Threats* â failures of hardware and/or software
   can affect network and system integrity or availability, and
   impede the ability of OpenC2 mechanisms to operate

 * *Environmental Threats* â disasters and infrastructure failures
   may need to addressed and accommodated depending on the
   mission needs of the defended networks

### B.2.3 Potential Attack Types

Malicious adversaries may use any form of attack, these are some
primary examples.

* *Passive Attacks* â An attacker may monitor traffic at levels
  of sophistication and access  ranging from simple traffic
  analysis (is there a change in the volume of OpenC2 traffic?)
  to eavesdropping on the contents of the messages (if
  unencrypted) to see what was detected, what actions are being
  taken, and the specific targets of OpenC2 commands.  This
  information will let the attacker know if their active attacks
  have been detected and how the system responds.  Their active
  attacks can then be revised to avoid detection or to trigger a
  known response.  In the latter case, the attacker could use
  knowledge of the response strategy to cause the system to
  unnecessarily deny services to users.

* *Active Attacks, Externally Initiated* â An attacker may try to
  manipulate OpenC2 traffic by deleting, delaying, or replaying
  legitimate messages.  They may also attempt to modify the
  contents of a message or masquerade as an OpenC2 Producer and
  issue bogus messages. Finally, an external attacker might be
  able to compromise a legitimate OpenC2 Producer within an
  environment; protection of an OpenC2 Producer should be a
  priority in any implementation of OpenC2. If any of these
  attacks succeed, the attacker can disrupt or disable responses
  to other attacks and can cause the defensive capabilities to
  impede legitimate operations. Successfully subverting defenses
  can allow more intrusive attacks.

* *Insider Attacks* (Malicious users) â An insider, especially a
  privileged user, may be able to more effectively perform any of
  the passive and active attacks already mentioned plus can act
  as a legitimate user to perform other actions.  These actions
  could include misconfiguring devices, changing policy rules,
  issuing malicious commands from authorized sources, and even
  turning systems off.

* *Supply Chain or Distribution Attacks* - A vendor, transporter,
  developer, or installer may modify the software or hardware
  used for OpenC2-based functions.  The modification may
  introduce an exploitable vulnerability, disable a critical
  function, or cause failure under specific conditions.  Even if
  the attack is just substitution of a counterfeit component, the
  behavior may be different and cause problems.

## B.3 Security Services

This section reviews the applicability of traditional security
services to OpenC2 operations. As OpenC2 specifies a _language_
(as opposed to a protocol or a system) that is subject to a range
of implementations, in a variety of environments, using a variety
of transfer protocols, data encodings, etc., this discussion does
not specify any particular mechanisms to implement these security
services. 

Implementations of OpenC2 should apply well-vetted and
widely-used industry standard mechanisms (e.g., as specified by
Internet Engineering Task Force [IETF] Requests for Comment
[RFCs]) compatible with other implementation choices to provide
security services. For example:

 * JSON-encoded messages could be protected using the techniques
   described in the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)
   family of RFCs, specifically [[RFC7515](#rfc7515)],
   [[RFC7516](#rfc7516)], and associated documents.

 * CBOR-encoded messages could be protected using the techniques
   described in the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
   family of RFCs, specifically [[RFC8152](#rfc8152)] and
   associated documents.


### B.3.1 Confidentiality

Confidentiality of OpenC2 message content prevents attackers from
seeing the response actions that result from attacker activities.
This knowledge could aid an attacker in manipulating or
circumventing cyber defenses. 

### B.3.2 Integrity

Both data and system integrity need to be addressed in OpenC2
implementations. Data integrity is extremely important - the
contents of a C2 message should not be modifiable without
detection.  Replay and re-sequencing attacks also need to be
addressed.  Message integrity must always be paired with source
authentication. System integrity including software/application
integrity is also critical to OpenC2 security.  If a system,
including system and application software, is not in a compliant,
stable configuration then its actions cannot be trusted.

### B.3.3 Availability

Availability in the context of OpenC2 is focused on the ability
of Producers to send commands to Consumers, and the corresponding
ability of Consumers to receive, execute, and send Responses to
those commands. Assuring availability can be very difficult if
the OpenC2 message traffic is carried in-band with the user
traffic. Out-of-band management networks should be used where
possible as they provide isolation of OpenC2 activities from
attacks against operational user networks and can be engineered
to provide better support for high availability. Also, approaches
to addressing intermittent connectivity and actions upon
reconnection should be addressed.


### B.3.4 Authentication

OpenC2 is envisioned for application in environments where C2
will be automated as much as possible.  In the consequent
machine-to-machine exchanges, the systems involved need to
securely authenticate that authorized systems are involved and
not rogue entities. In particular, actuators receiving and
executing OpenC2 commands must be able to confirm those commands
came from a source that can confidently be authenticated.  With
the increasing number of Internet-enabled devices, reliable
machine authentication is crucial to allow secure communication
in automated network environments. In any architecture
deployment, consider the appropriate levels and types of
authentication for managers and actuators.  

There are also aspects of identity and credential management that
need to be addressed:  uniqueness of name space, identification
of device type and instance, provisioning of credentials
(typically digital certificates), means to verify trust chain and
current status of credentials, means to revoke credentials, and
session management.  There are many challenges to find the right
authentication model that can support a machine-to-machine
communication method depending on the range of device and network
capabilities in the operating environment.

### B.3.5 Authorization And Access Control

Coupled with user or device authentication, a requesting entity
must have authorization before tasks are executed on its
direction. Authorization is the process of enforcing policies:
determining what types of actions on a resource or service are
permitted for this Producer.  Once a Producer has been
authenticated, they may be authorized for different types of
actions depending on the policy assigned.  The authorization
should be role- or attribute-based to avoid the problems of
maintaining an identity-based access control list.

The policy rules may include conditional aspects such as time of
day or operational status of network to prevent actions from
adversely affecting missions.  In these cases, it is important to
determine if the Producer has knowledge of the conditions and can
self-impose the policy rules or whether the policy needs to be
enforced at (or near) the resource.

### B.3.6 Accountability

Authentication is also the basis for associating the Producer
with the commands sent, the authorization decision (allow or
deny), and the actions taken.  The authenticated identity of the
actor along with the action is captured in the audit logs and
provides traceability to the responsible party.

### B.3.7 Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation may be required if there is a requirement to
formally prove the issuance or receipt of a C2 message, however
any non-repudiation requirement should be evaluated critically
due to impacts on the processing, availability and delays of
automated cyber defense actions.  This level of security may not
be required in a closed system where source authentication and
logged receipt events are sufficient evidence of who sent and who
received messages.  Non-repudiation implementations may require a
third party acting as a notary or signature-based message
authentication resulting in additional costs in terms of
processing, communications, and invoking third-party services for
the commands and responses.  A time stamping service will
typically also be required.  The third party would timestamp
OpenC2 messages and certify proof of issuance and delivery.  This
will add dependencies and overhead to the system.

### B.3.8 Auditing

Audit trails are necessary in any secure system but have specific
considerations in machine-to-machine communications.  In
conjunction with appropriate tools and procedures, audit trails
can provide a means to help accomplish several security-related
objectives, including individual accountability, reconstruction
of events, intrusion detection, and problem identification.
Typical events include:

 * Authentication exchange between components (manager, actuator,
   and end points)
 * Message generated, message sent, message received
 * Action taken/allowed or request denied
 * Success or failure of any OpenC2 exchange
 * Configuration changes

Actions and the results that are invoked using OpenC2 should be
recorded and analyzed for security areas such as forensics,
secure implementation, security architecture of impact changes
within the environment, and completion of such tasks.  This type
of auditing provides the essential ingredients for early
detection of actions that violate security policy.

### B.3.9 Metrics Collection And Analysis

Collecting metrics will be necessary for a multitude of
activities to assess performance and improve effectiveness of
actions within an OpenC2 environment.  Implementations should
provide the ability to measure resources a user or system
component (e.g., sensors and actuators) consumes.  This could
include the amount of system time or quantity of messages it has
sent or received during a session.  This can be accomplished by
logging of session statistics and usage information and is used
for trend analysis, resource utilization, performance assessment,
and capacity planning.  Overall all of these are important data
captures to improve the configuration and deployment of OpenC2
components and a verification that operations are working as
intended.



## B.4 Network Topologies

The available networking architecture, topology, and technology
all have implications for, and may also be constrained by, OpenC2
use and security.  The topology and communications modes
supporting OpenC2 traffic will affect the ability and approaches
to achieving robustness, providing redundancy, and meeting
responsiveness goals. Ideally, OpenC2 traffic should be quickly
and reliably delivered to all intended recipients with some
guarantee or confirmation of both delivery and action taken. It
will not always be possible to achieve these goals due to
constraints of available or legacy networking and systems,
mobility/connectedness of devices, effects of attacks or outages
in the network, and management/cost factors.  

### B.4.1 In-Band Cyber Defense C2

If OpenC2 traffic is carried in-band with user and other traffic,
then it is subject to the same threats (plus the threats against
cyber defense C2) and will leverage the same defenses as the
other traffic. Besides being subject to the same external threats
as the other traffic, the implementer also needs to consider:

 * *Resource contention issues*: C2 traffic may be delayed or
   blocked by high volumes of user traffic or reductions in
   network capacity or connectivity

 * *Intended cyber defense actions*: The same blocking or filtering
   of traffic meant to stop an external attacker may affect C2
   traffic flow as well (e.g., external monitoring feeds could be
   cut off)
 * *Targeted attacks against cyber defense C2*: The attacker may
   specifically attempt to single out C2 traffic for intercept,
   modification, denial of service, or other attack

### B.4.2 Out-Of-Band Cyber Defense C2

Out-of-Band management (OOBM) involves the use of a dedicated
channel for managing network devices. OOBM allows the network
operator to establish trust boundaries around accessing the
management function to apply it to network resources. Depending
on the specific implementation, OOBM also can be used to ensure
management connectivity (including the ability to determine the
status of any network component) independent of the status of
in-band network components. OOBM is a common best practice with
renewed focus based on the evolving threat landscape. There are a
range of potential implementations of OOBM, from an entirely
physically-separated network to approaches that apply logical
separation (e.g., virtual LANs [VLAN]) on the network backbone to
separate management traffic from ordinary user traffic.

C2 systems are prime objectives of adversaries and OOBM can
provide another layer in the defense-in-depth model.  The
effectiveness of this layering or separation depends on how OOBM
is implemented and secured.  There should be a much lower attack
surface since general users would not have access to this
channel.  Also security policies, generally, will restrict or
prohibit connection to the OOBM through access control lists or
other access methods.  In practice though, implementations may
have prioritized administrator access (including remote access)
and chosen weaker security.  For example, implementers may have
left back-door access in place so that disastrous failures can
rapidly be fixed.  To address these types of issues, a security
plan should be implemented and enforced, focusing in these areas,
which will enhance the entire security architecture of the
enterprise: 
 * Definitions of vulnerabilities and risks of out-of-band access
for OpenC2 
 * Review security architecture for mitigating those risks 
 * Proper balance between security and the need for timely
out-of-band access during critical events 
 * Systems of processes, equipment and technologies that provide,
wherever required for OpenC2 integrity, confidentiality, and/or
non-repudiation for out-of-band access.

# Appendix E. Examples

## E.1 Application of Actuator Profiles and Transfer Specifications

This example illustrates the application of the various types of
OpenC2 specifications. Figure E-1 shows a simple operating
environment with five components:

 - A Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
   system that is the OpenC2 Producer in the environment,
   directing the operation of OpenC2-enabled cyber defense
   functions.
  
 - A Publish / Subscribe message broker to support communications
   among the other components.
  
 - Three OpenC2 Consumers:
   - An IP-Connected camera, illustrative of an Internet of
     Things (IoT) Consumer;
   - A Laptop, illustrative of a general purpose endpoint
     consumer;
   - A Firewall, illustrative of a network infrastructure
     consumer.

##### Figure E-1: Application of Actuator Profiles and Transfer Specifications
![Figure E-1](images/Arch-Example-1.drawio.png)

The diagram also shows a collection of OpenC2 specifications, and
tags the components with the specifications relevant to their
participation in OpenC2 exchanges:

 - The OpenC2 Language Specification
 - A Publish / Subscribe Transfer Specification
 - Three Actuator Profiles:
   - Endpoint Response (tagged "E")
   - Packet Filtering ("P")
   - Software Bill of Material (SBOM) Retrieval ("S")

Colored circles on each of the components identify which
specifications are relevant to that component:

 - The message broker needs to conform to the publish / subscribe
   protocol called out in the Transfer Specification, but does
   not have any OpenC2-specific requirements.

 - Messaging is defined by a combination of information from the
   Language Specification and the Transfer Specification,
   indicated by a bi-colored (red/blue) bubble. This function is
   relevant to all of the OpenC2 components.
 - All IP-connected camera must support the SBOM Retrieval AP.
 - The laptop (Endpoint Consumer) must support the SBOM Retrieval
   AP and the Endpoint Respose AP.
 - The firewall (Infrastructure Consumer) must support the SBOM
   Retrieval AP and the Packet Filtering AP.

## E.2 Actuator Profile Typical Content

This example provides an overview of the typical structure and
content of an OpenC2 Acuator Profile.

### 1.0 Introduction

This section provides a brief overview of the cyber defense
function addressed in this AP.

### 2.0 OpenC2 Language Binding

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Arguments, and
Actuator Specifiers that are meaningful in the context of PF and
the appropriate status codes, status texts, and other properties
of a Response message. This section is also where any AP-specific
extentions to the language are defined.

#### 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components

This section identifies the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Arguments,
and Target and Actuator Specifiers needed for this AP. Depending
on the needs of the AP, extended targets, arguments, and
specifiers can be defined in this section.

#### 2.2 OpenC2 Response Components

This section defines common and unique responses neede for this
AP, and the response status codes that are applicable.

#### 2.3 OpenC2 Commands

This section defines the commands (i.e., Action / Target pairs)
used for the control of the cyber defense function. A matrix is
used to identify the valid pairs:

|          | action 1 | action 2 | action 3 | action 4 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| target A |          |   valid  |          |          |
| target B |   valid  |   valid  |          |          |
| target C |          |          |   valid  |   valid  |


A second table links the valid commands to the available
arguments, and links to the subsequent section where this command
is discussed in detail.

|            |   command 1   |   command 2   |   command 3   |   command 4   | command 5     |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|---------------|
| argument 1 | section a.b.c |               | section a.b.e |               |               |
| argument 2 | section a.b.c | section a.b.d |               |               |               |
| argument 3 | section a.b.c |               |               | section a.b.f | section a.b.g |

Subsequent subsections provide needed details about each command
and its relevant arguments.

### 3.0 Conformance

This section provides the conformance clauses required in an
OASIS specification. Clauses are grouped into those applicable to
Producers using this AP to generate commands and those applicable
to Consumers receiving and executing those commands.

#### 3.1 Clauses Pertaining to the OpenC2 Producer Conformance Target

 - Baseline Producer Clauses
 - Specific Producer Clause 1
 - Specific Producer Clause 2
 - ...
 - Specific Producer Clause _n_


#### 3.2 Clauses Pertaining to the OpenC2 Consumer Conformance Target

 - Baseline Consumer Clauses

### Appendix E. Examples

Examples of commands and responses that illustrate the use of
this AP will be found in Appendix E.


## E.3 Transfer Specification Typical Content


This example provides an overview of the typical structure and
content of an OpenC2 Transfer Specification.

### 1.0 Introduction

This section provides a brief introduction to the transfer
protocol that is the focus of this transfer specification.

### 2.0 Operating Model

This section provides an overview of the approach employed to use
the transfer protocols in support of OpenC2 messaging. A
description of how OpenC2 messages are packaged for transfer in
the protocol is needed. Other content of the section is flexible
based on the characteristics of the protocol in use. For example,
a subsection of 2.0 would describe the topic structure used in a
publish / subscribe environment, or which protocol features are
used in a specific way for OpenC2 messaging.

### 3.0 Protocol Mapping

This section defines specific requirements to use the transfer
protocol to implement the operating model, and provides details
as needed to apply the standard that describe the protocol.
Similar to section 2, the structure of this ection if flexible
based on the characteristics of the protocol in use.

### 4.0 Conformance

This section provides the conformance clauses required in an
OASIS specification.  Clauses may or may not be grouped into
those applicable to Producers and those applicable to Consumers
receiving and executing those commands, depending on the nature
of the protocol in use.


### Appendix E. Examples

Examples of message transfer that illustrate the use of this
transfer specifcation will be found in Appendix E.

# Appendix F. OpenC2 Namespace Procedures

This appendix describes how the OpenC2 TC manages namespaces for JADN schemas.
The current OpenC2 namespace registry is stored on GitHub in the repository for
this specification:
[namespace-registry.md](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-oc2arch/blob/published/namespace-registry.md).


## F.1 Namespace Concepts
A [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) is a set
of names used to identify objects. A namespace ensures that all
of a given set of objects can be easily identified and
unambiguously referenced.

All OpenC2 type definitions are contained in a specification and its associated JADN schema, and
each specification is assigned a globally-unique namespace in the
form of a URI.  Types in one specification can reference types
defined in another specification using a namespaced name:

    name = <namespace identifier> separator <local name>

The XML standard includes namespaces but JSON does not. Because
OpenC2 consists of multiple specifications, it requires a
namespacing mechanism usable with JSON data. OpenC2 has therefore
created a naming approach similar to XML's that can be applied to
non-namespaced data formats such as JSON.  For brevity the
approach assigns a short Namespace Identifier (NSID) to each
referenced namespace using an **import** statement, then uses the
NSID as a prefix to each referenced type:

**schema**:
```
import: {"ex": "http://www.example.com/datatypes/v1.2"}

Person = Record
    1 name   String
    2 id     Integer
    3 email  ex:Email-Address  // type definition imported/resolved from another specification
```
**JSON data**:
```
    {"name": "John", "id": 12345, "email": "john@acme.com"}
```
Namespacing thus involves four different values:
* **Namespace**: The unique identifier of a referenced
  specification: `http://www.example.com/datatypes/v1.2`
* **Type Name**: the name of a type defined in a referenced
  specification: `Email-Address`
* **NSID**: a short abbreviation for a Namespace used as a prefix
  with an imported type: `ex`
* **Field Name**: may be serialized as a JSON object property
  whose value is an imported type: `email`

This approach uses a resolver to look up all namespaced type
definitions from their defining specifications and incorporates
them into a single schema. Schema authors can manually copy and paste
definitions into a monolithic specification, but namespace
resolution automates that process, eliminating redundancy and the
potential for inconsistency.

A namespace URI is only an identifier. For syntactic reasons it
must have a scheme (http) but it is not a network-accessible
resource. Referenced specifications do not need to be available
online and implementations are not required to do namespace
resolution at runtime, although dynamic namespace resolution may
be appropriate for some use cases. URLs for online schemas should
be derived from the namespace using scheme "https", filename
"schema", and the applicable file extension: ".jadn" for the
abstract schema, and ".json", ".xsd", ".cddl", ".proto", etc. for
corresponding concrete schemas.

> NOTE: need to resolve inconsistency between the foregoing sentence and the
> approach described in F.2 and illustrated in Figure F-1. Focal point is the
> naming of the schema file: `schema.jadn` vs. `shortname.jadn`.

## F.2 Registration Process

The OASIS Naming Directives [[OASIS-Naming](#oasis-naming)] include guidance on the
assignment of XML namespaces (Section 8), which OpenC2 has adapted for use with
JADN schemas developed for the OpenC2 language specification and actuator profiles. The
pattern for an OASIS namespace is:

<center><strong>http://docs.oasis-open.org/[tc-shortname]/ns/xxxx</strong></center>
<br>

For OpenC2 the `[tc-shortname]` portion is `openc2`.

The **`xxxx`** portion of the pattern is defined according to the needs of the
TC. OpenC2 needs namespaces for the language specification, actuator profiles,
and external data types that are needed for integration with OpenC2
applications. These are addressed by defining  **`xxxx`** as follows:

* Language:  the OpenC2 language schema is divided into two packages, each with a namespace:
  * **`lang`** for the base language specification (e.g., message formats), and 
  * **`types`** for the collection of common data types used in the language and
    actuator profile schemas
* Actuator Profiles:  use the short form name for the AP (e.g.,  **`pf`**,
  **`hunt`**) as assigned during the initial definition of the work product.
  This connects AP GitHub repository names and namespaces:
  - Repository: https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-hunt
  - Namespace http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/ns/ap/hunt/v2.0
* Externals: names are developed as needed, and approved through the TC working
  meetings process. External namspaces are grouped under `**ext**`
  - example:  `**sco**` for STIX Cyber-security Observables
  - http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/ns/ext/sco/v2.1

OpenC2-developed schemas and namespaces for externals should be replaced by the
corresponding items from the authorities for those externals, in the event those
authorities adopt JADN as a schema language.

The following example illustrates the application of these conventions for the SBOM Retrieval AP:

* **AP Name**: ap-\<function-shorthand\> (e.g.,
  **`sbom`** for SBOM Retrieval), hence **`ap-sbom`**.
* **AP Specification URL**:
  https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/ap-abom/v2.0/ap-sbom-v2.0.html
* **AP Namespace**: http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/ap/sbom/v2.0
* **AP GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-sbom

Namespaces are recorded in the [[OpenC2 Namespace Registry](#openc2-ns-reg)]
along with the short name for the work product or external entity.  Actuator
Profiles are also assigned a numeric Property ID that is used to reference them
within the language schema.

Figure F-1 illustrates the relationships among these concepts.

Custom actuator profile namespaces are chosen by the profile
author and should be chosen to avoid conflict with namespace URIs
registered here. Custom profile authors may register Namespaces
under `http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/ns/custom` but are not required to
do so.
